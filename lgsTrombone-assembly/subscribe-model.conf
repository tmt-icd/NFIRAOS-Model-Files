This rate is an integer multiple (240x) of the RTC frame period and possibly could be increased to reduce defocus allocation in WFE error budget, based on the Craig Irvin's coop report [<a href="https://docushare.tmt.org/docushare/dsweb/Get/Document-18476">Meteor Tracking with Trombone Correction</a>, (TMT.AOS.TEC.10.064)].*
