The LGS trombone integrate the focus error from the RTC to compensate for changes in the sodium layer altitude

*Discussion: The RTC computes the LGS focus error term at a 3.33Hz sampling frequency (0.3 second period), based on the LGS WFS gradients using a standard centroid algorithm. This rate is an integer multiple (240x) of the RTC frame period and possibly could be increased to reduce defocus allocation in WFE error budget, based on the Craig Irvin's coop report [<a href="https://docushare.tmt.org/docushare/dsweb/Get/Document-18476">Meteor Tracking with Trombone Correction</a>, (TMT.AOS.TEC.10.064)].*
