      <em>
      Discussion: The NFIRAOS Optical Enclosure environment is controlled by a PLC. When in 'Auto' mode it makes its own decisions regarding maintenance tasks, such as defrosting heating panels (CDPD). Since client instruments are open to the internal NFIRAOS environment, they are coupled to the states of this PLC. The only environmental maintenance task presently expected of IRIS is to defrost its cooling panels. In order to ensure that this task does not interfere with NFIRAOS, the NFIRAOS panel defrost schedule can include entries for the bottom port, side port, and top port instruments. If the PLC is in the auto mode, state is CDPD, and the first element of both instDefrost  and instConnected is True, then it is safe for IRIS to activate its panel defrost heater, provided it can finish before the published stateEnd timestamp, in International Atomic Time (TAI) / Precision Time Protocol (PTP), by which defrosting must finish. Otherwise it shall wait until the next time these values are published.

      Discussion: The Assembly has a configuration that will list what is connected at each port.

      Discussion: Frost point is germane below 0<sup>&deg;</sup>C and dewpoint applies above freezing.  Condensation temperature (Frost and dew point ) is a  more directly useful measurement of water vapour than relative humidity --  if the air temperature is below the condensation point, then water will precipitate.
