This command the deactivate the NRTC pipeline, via the pipelineDeactivate command, and will reset all internal states to default values, clear any mode configuration parameters and then request the specified configuration file from the TMT Configuration Service. Upon receiving the configuration file from the TMT configuration service, the NRTC will parse the configuration data and load it into memory. Additionally, by clearing the AO mode, this will stop all pixel reading until the AO mode is (re)set by the mode command.

An equivalent result to this command can be achieved by restarting the NRTC Assembly.

Discussion: There should be a convention to tell the NRTC to use a local version of the configure file(s) for engineering/integration purposes when the TMT configuration service is not yet available. This could be embedded in the configuration name/version.

Once the AO mode has been configured the RTC will begin to listen to pixels streams and perform pixel calibration for quick-look GUIs, however will not will not be saved or processed further.

The command will also configure which detector input streams will be used for low-order correction. These streams are split into tiers as listed below:
<ul>
<li> Tier 0 (optional)  PWFS providing TT(FA) measurements for acquisition purposes
<li> Tier 1 (required)  single detector that provides LO TTF(A) measurements 
<li> Tier 2 (optional)  1 to 2 detectors that provide LO TT or LO TTF(A) measurements
<li> Tier 3 (optional)  1 to 4 detectors that provide LOT TT measurements
<li> Tier 3F (optional)  single detector that provides LOT focus measurements
</ul>
The restrictions for Tier assignments are given below:
<ul>
<li> Tier 0 can only be the PWFS
<li> Tier 1 must be either the PWFS or a TTF OIWFS
<li> Tier 2 can be the PWFS or any TT/TTF OIWFS or ODGW
<li> Tier 3 can be any OIWFS or ODGW
<li> Tier 3F can only be a TTF OIWFS
<li> a single detector can be assigned to multiple tiers
<li> the same detector cannot be assigned to the same tier twice
<li> the same detector cannot be assigned to both Tier 1 and Tier 2
</ul>

For Tiers 2 and 3, the order in which the detectors are specified defines the order in which the gradients will be assembled for low-order and low-order truth mode reconstruction. If a tier entry is specified as NONE, then that entry is skipped while assembling the low-order gradient vector.

The wavefront corrector rate must be a multiple of the high-order loop rate and the steady-state low-order loop rate. The steady-state low-order loop rate must be a multiple of the steady-state low-order truth loop rate.

Any OIWFS that is assigned to Tier 1 or Tier 3F must be set to TTF mode, while any OIWFS that is assigned to Tier 2 or Tier 3 can be either set to TT or TTF mode. All OIWFSs not assigned to a low-order tier must be set to the NONE mode.

This command applies to all enabled LGS WFSs. If the number of frames to average is specified then the NRTC will average the specified number of frames to measure the current backgrounds. The current detector backgrounds, specified in the configuration file, are subtracted from the measured backgrounds to produce the sky & instrument backgrounds. These sky & instrument backgrounds are then normalized to a 1 second exposure and stored as the current normalized LGS WFS sky & instrument backgrounds in the NRTC, as which point the command returns. Subsequent call to this command will replace the normalized sky & instrument backgrounds and calls to the init command will reset all backgrounds to the defaults specified in the configuration file.

If the sky configuration name input parameter is specified, then the NRTC will save the current normalized sky & instrument backgrounds to the TMT Configuration Service using the configuration name given, after generating a new backgrounds if instructed to do so (i.e. number of frames to average is specified). Note that the configuration file will only contain the normalized sky & instrument backgrounds, and should be different from the configuration name used by the init command.

If neither input argument is specified, then this command will return with an error.

If pixels are not received from all enabled LGS WFSs in a timely manner (TBD), then this command will return with an error and no backgrounds will be updated or saved.

A call to the stop command will abort this process.

Discussion: It is assumed that the lasers will be detuned before executing this command so the sky & instrument backgrounds will include Rayleigh backscattering.

This command is intended to stop the NRTC data processing, i.e. at the end of a night.

This command also stops the RTS and HOP servers from saving telemetry and pixel data.

Discussion: It is anticipated that pixel reading will always occur as long as the AO mode is set; it is therefore unaffected by this command. However, any pixels read while in this state are simply calibrated but not stored and will not be processed further.

This dither signal is completely independent of the LGS dither signal described in the loopLgsDither command.

If NONE is selected, then the NRTC will not dither DM0 and will ignore the NGS FSM position stream. If the PWFS gradient optimization algorithm is set to optical gain optimization (pwfsState.algo == GOG_UPDATE) and the dithering is disabled, then the PWFS gradient optimization is halted (pwfsState.algo == COG_STATIC).

A MIRROR input corresponds to sending a raw zero command to the TTS, meaning the stage is zeroed with respect to physical unit rotation relative to its mount.
